# TryHackMe notes

## Jr Penetration Tester module

### Description

Hands-on notes based on Jr Penetration Tester TryHackMe module, tasks writeups are not covered.

### Usage

These notes are targetted mostly at practical use, which is why all topics are covered rather briefly and without much explanation but include many practical use-cases for theory explained in the course. They are made strictly to just jump into a certain topic and remind general idea behind some idea, which could be not particularly good for learning a new area.
